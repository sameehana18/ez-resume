Here’s a brief roadmap to help you build your project step-by-step using the MERN stack with JWT authentication:

Phase 1: Backend Development
Set Up the Backend:

Initialize a Node.js project using npm init.
Install essential packages:
bash
Copy code
npm install express mongoose bcrypt jsonwebtoken cors dotenv
Set up a basic Express server.
Database Setup:

Install MongoDB locally or use a free MongoDB Atlas cluster.
Connect MongoDB to your server using the Mongoose library.
User Authentication (JWT):

Create a User model with fields like name, email, password, and createdAt.
Implement the following routes:
Register: Save user info after hashing the password with bcrypt.
Login: Validate the email/password and return a JWT token.
Protected Routes: Use JWT middleware to restrict access to authenticated users.
Resume API:

Create a Resume model with fields like title, data, userId, fileUrl, and previewUrl.
Implement CRUD operations:
Create a Resume: Save data in MongoDB.
Fetch All Resumes: Get all resumes for the logged-in user.
Update/Delete Resume: Modify or remove existing resumes.
Phase 2: Frontend Development
Set Up React:

Create a React app using create-react-app.
Install required packages:
bash
Copy code
npm install axios react-router-dom
Set up React Router for navigation (e.g., login, register, dashboard, resume editor).
User Authentication:

Build the Login and Register pages.
Store the JWT token in localStorage or sessionStorage after login.
Create a utility to attach the JWT token in API requests (e.g., using Axios interceptors).
Dashboard:

Fetch the user’s resumes using the API and display them as cards (like your screenshot).
Add a "Create New" button to navigate to the resume editor.
Resume Editor:

Create a form for users to input data (e.g., personal info, education, etc.).
Use state management (React’s useState or useReducer) to update the resume data.
Display the real-time preview using the form inputs.
Download Option:

Add a "Download" button to trigger a backend API call to generate a PDF/Word file (use Puppeteer).
Phase 3: File Storage and Deployment
Cloudinary Integration:

Install the Cloudinary package on the backend to handle file uploads.
Upload generated files and save the URLs in MongoDB.
Frontend Enhancements:

Display the resume previews in the dashboard using the Cloudinary thumbnail URLs.
Deployment:

Deploy the backend to platforms like Render or Railway (free-tier).
Deploy the frontend to Netlify or Vercel.
Use MongoDB Atlas for database hosting.
Tools and Resources
Backend:

Postman: For testing APIs.
Cloudinary: Free file hosting for resumes.
Frontend:

React Icons: For icons on the dashboard.
Formik + Yup: For form handling and validation.
Deployment:

Render or Railway (backend).
Netlify or Vercel (frontend).


Suggested Order of Implementation
Backend: Set up user authentication (register/login with JWT).
Backend: Implement the resume CRUD API.
Frontend: Build the login/register pages.
Frontend: Set up the dashboard and fetch resumes.
Frontend: Add the resume editor with real-time preview.
Backend: Integrate Cloudinary for file uploads.
Backend: Add PDF/Word file generation for download.
Deployment: Host the backend, frontend, and database.
